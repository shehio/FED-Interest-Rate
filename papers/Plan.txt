The plan:
---------

We chose features that we thought are related to predicting the interest rate.
We ran OLS on the features with the interest rate as the response variable.
The p-value for the Null hypothesis (the data comes from a Normal distribution) for every feature was equal to zero.
Meaning the model features are correlated. Now we have to do a covariance matrix.
